In your own terms, define the following terms:

What is HTTP?
What is a URL?
What is DNS?
What is a query string?
What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
What is an HTTP request?
What is an HTTP response?
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?

1. HTTP is a hypertext transfer protocol, it's a system of rules which standardizes how information is communicated across a network which uses the protocol.
2. Uniform Resource Locator, it's an identifying string for a certain webpage that your browser makes to request a webpage or certain resources and that the 
web server uses to serve those resources. 
3. Domain Name Service. A service that can take a given hostname of a site and look up the corresponding IP address in order for the browser to 
request resources from the correct site.
4. It's a string that can be attached to the end of a hostname query that the browser puts in, in order to specify certain parameters about what it's requesting
5. GET, is a type of request that the browser makes, but it doesn't change any information on the server side. POST is another request type but it does change info 
server side. 
6. It's the communication that a browser sends to a wev server, asking it to send back certain resources.
7. It's the communication the web server send back, which contains a response code as to the status of the request, and hopefully also with response body.
8. It's a section of a response or request which contains metadata about the communication. 
9. First the browser will try to locate the Ip address that corresponds to "somesite.com". This will be done by checking the local cache, the router, the 
ISP, and then a DNS server. Then, the browser will send a request to that address, using the htt protocol, asking for the /some/page.html resource at 
that ip address.
